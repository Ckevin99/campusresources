                <p>R Mountain (Menan, 3.4 miles, Moderate) The “R” mountain,  also known as the Menan Butte is a famously known hike among locals and students that live in Rexburg, ID. It is not really a mountain but an inactive volcano. Hikers will enjoy this landmark with 2 trailheads to explore seeing wildlife and plantlife most of the year. Don’t be deceived by the shortness of the hike and wear flip flops. Sturdy shoes are necessary and you might want to bring water and a sack lunch so when you reach the top you can enjoy the view of the valley.</p>
                <p>Cress Creek (Ririe, 1.3 miles, Moderate) Head out on this 1.3-mile loop trail near Ririe, Idaho. Generally considered a moderately challenging route, it takes an average of 41 min to complete. This is a popular trail for birding, hiking, and running, but you can still enjoy some solitude during quieter times of day. The best times to visit this trail are May through October. Dogs are welcome and may be off-leash in some areas.</p>
                <p>Big Springs (1.5 miles, Moderate) Located in Island Park, Big Springs is one of the 40 largest springs in the country and is a significant source for the headwaters of the Henry’s Fork of the Snake River. More than 120 million gallons of crystal-clear water flows from the ground daily and the water maintains a year-round temperature of 52 degrees Fahrenheit, perfect for the fish species that live in the area.</p>
                <p>Mesa Falls (9.1 miles, Difficult) At Upper Mesa Falls, a thunderous curtain of water – as tall as a 10-story building – pours over remnants of an ancient volcanic super-eruption that spewed ash over much of the current US. A mile south, Lower Mesa Falls repeats the performance; the river continually chiseling away at the solidified ash and lava. Some layers are more than a million years old. Today, Upper and Lower Mesa Falls are the last prominent waterfalls on the Snake River to resist human control.</p>
                <p>Box Canyon (4.3 miles, Moderate) Earl M. Hardy Box Canyon Springs Nature Preserve is a sight to be seen. Being the 11th largest spring in North America, the crystal clear waters are one you must add to the bucket-list.</p>
                <p>Island Park Trails This small town 55 miles out of rexburg is full of great nature trails, ranging from Targhee Creek to the Thurmon Creek.</p>
